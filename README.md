# Hella Farm

*Do sacrificed lambs go to heaven?*

## ℹ️ About

Another short incremental game about dragging and flinging sheeps and demons around a farm!

Buy a sheep or two, sacrifice them to summon an entity from beyond, and deal with it while trying to get the most gold coins possible!

Then... perhaps sacrifice the entity itself to summon a stronger one, or...

Make your sheep wear a top hat?

Sacrifice fancy sheep?

Where does that skull come from?

### Recipes

Drag five entities on the five pedestals in the middle of the farm to perform a summoning!

The results depend on what's on the pedestals:

- 5 Sheep → 1 Imp
- 5 Imps → 1 Chupacabra
- 1 Skull + 4 *Any* → 1 Chupacabra
- 5 Chupacabras → 1 Watcher
- 5 *Entities with a top hat* → 1 Watcher + 5 Top Hats
- 5 *Entities with a monocle* → 1 Watcher + 5 Monocles
- 5 Watchers → 1 Cthulhu

Skulls are rarely produced when sheep are eaten by a demon.

Sheep have a rare chance to spawn with either a top hat or a monocle, and they will drop it on death. Any entity will wear them on contact.
